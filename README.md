# Methodology
This application is built with plain old HTML and Bootstrap for CSS. I'm also using a Bootstrap theme called Simplex which makes things look a tiny bit better.

The Javascript part of the site is powered by Vue.js, a very simple Javascript framework.

I'm also using:

vue2-filters, a simple Vue.js library that provides some useful template filters for displaying text. In this app, I only the filter for helping to display currency values nicely.
axios, a simple Javascript library for making HTTP requests
Finally, the data on this website is powered by two separate, free, API services:

coinmarketcap, which provides a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, and their price details, and
cryptocompare, which provides metadata about all cryptocurrencies, including their respective logo images (which is what I use this for)

# Description

It uses plain old HTML, Javascript, and CSS to render a very simple, one page application that shows you:

The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap
All cryptocurrency prices over the last hour, day, and week
This is useful for people interested in speculating on the cryptocurrency marketplaces, as you can take a look at short term performance to get a feel for how you'd like to speculate.
